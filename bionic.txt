The reader’s brain contains a complicated set of mechanisms admirably attuned to reading.
For a great many centuries, this talent remained a mystery.
Today, the brain’s black box is cracked open and a true science of reading is coming into being.
Advances in psychology and neuroscience over the last twenty years have begun to unravel the principles 
underlying the brain’s reading circuits.
Modern brain imaging methods now reveal, in just a matter of minutes, the brain areas
that activate when we decipher written words. Scientists can track a printed word as it 
progresses from the retina through a chain of processing stages, each of which is 
marked by an Elementary Question: 

        Are these letters? 
        What do they look like? 
        Are they a word?
        What does it sound like?
        How is it pronounced? What does it mean?
